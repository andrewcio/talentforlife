## Why

Look.

In the broadest sense of the term, we are all designers. And we ruined it.

We do what we know when we hurt. When we need to express ourselves, we create.

This site exists to connect creatives and doers to the organizations that exist to fight back by providing actionable direction for channeling this creativity.

## This is how it works

### Steps

1. Inventory your time, decide on what you can donate and prepare yourself by setting realistic goals
2. Find your state by searching
3. Reach out to one, or many, of these organizations OR contribute to list
4. Support them with your skills 
5. Hope that this branch of the universal wave function improves

Ten minutes here, a couple hours here, we've amassed knowledge and skills working for organizations who, for better or for worse, have been successful. Now let's use those powers in the right direction.

Working for free sucks. Working for mission driven organizations is great. Find a middle ground. This is purely a resource. This service is provided as-is and is intended to help connect idle hands with hands that need help. So let's hope that this isn't abused.

### Contribute

Edit these pages using GitHub. This is the format for each listing:

```
- Title
    - Website URL
    - Contact email address or URL to contact page
```
