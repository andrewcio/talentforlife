Talent For Life
===============

> Donate your talent, time, and resources to organizations hell bent on change.


## Why

This site exists to connect creatives and doers to the organizations that are fighting for their lives by optimizing some of the leg work necessary to get the process started. 

The goal is to provide actionable direction for channeling creative energy in supporting Black voices in lieu of misdirected creativity contributing to the noise. 

In other words, our posters are beautiful... but they would work better with strategic messaging and execution in mind. Let's get some briefs together and do intentional work.

## This is how it works

### Steps

1. Inventory your time, decide on what you can donate and prepare yourself by setting realistic goals
2. Find your state in the sidebar
3. Using the email template below, reach out to one, or many, of these organizations

```
Subject: Talent For Life: <your name>

Hello,

My name is <your name> and I want to offer my support to your organization. 

These are the skills/services I can offer:
- <list each skill> 
- <as a bullet point>

You can learn more about me via these links:
- <list each personal link >
- <e.g. portfolio, twitter, instagram>

Thank you for the work that you do! 

```

4. Support them with your skills and time
5. Hope that this branch of the universal wave function improves

Ten minutes here, a couple hours here, we've amassed knowledge and skills working for organizations who, for better or for worse, have been successful. Now let's use those powers in the right direction.

Disclaimer: Working for free sucks. Working for mission driven organizations is great. Find a middle ground. This is purely a resource. This service is provided as-is and is intended to help connect idle hands with hands that need help. So let's hope that this isn't abused.
