Talent For Life
===============

> Use this resource to find direct links for getting connected with organizations in your state.


## Why

This resource exists to connect creatives, doers, and all other types of volunteers to the organizations that are fighting for life and justic by cutting out some of the leg work necessary to get the process started. 

The goal is to provide actionable direction for channeling creative energy in supporting Black voices in lieu of misdirected, but well intentioned, creativity and energy.

-------

Ten minutes here, a couple hours here, we've amassed knowledge and skills working for organizations who, for better or for worse, have been successful. Now let's use those powers in the right direction.

Disclaimer: Doing company work for free sucks (say no to spec). Working for mission driven organizations, on the other hand, is great. However, not everyone can work for free or has the privilege of free time. Find a middle ground if pro-bono or in-person volunteering aren't things that can be offered. Steward boundaries. This is purely a resource and is provided as-is. It is intended to help connect idle hands with hands that need help. So let's operate on a good faith basis.
